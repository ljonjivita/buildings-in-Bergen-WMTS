# buildings-in-Bergen-WMTS

A webpage showing the buildings in Bergen as a WMTS.

It was supposed to be the same map as the WMS page (hiking trail),
but because of some difficulties with one of the layers it would load as a WMTS.
So this is more an excersise for me than an actual working map service.
